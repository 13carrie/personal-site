        <h4>Welcome to my website!</h4>
    <p>My name is Carrie Smith and I am a Year 3 BSc Hons Computer Science student at King's College London</p>
    <p>A few things I'm interested in right now (in no particular order):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anything written by Kevin Mitnick (currently working on 'The Art of Intrusion')</li>
        <li>Painting, both portrait and landscape</li>
        <li>My ongoing undergraduate dissertation - using machine learning to detect and explain network 
attacks</li>
        <li>Web vulnerabilities (therefore, exploring Burp and PHP programming)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>As you can almost certainly tell, this is a work-in-progress page. Thanks for your patience.</p>
