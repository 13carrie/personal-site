    <h3>Welcome to my art page!</h4>
    <p>This page showcases the pieces of art that I have made over the past 5 years. I have always had a passion for art, and was lucky to 
have two great art and art history teachers who challenged and supported me in high school. Now that computer science is my focus, art is now 
a way to blow off steam or to make unique gifts for the people I love. </p>
    <p>I mainly work with acrylic and pencil.</p>
    <p>Once my exams are all over, I will add all my art to this page with descriptions and other fun things.</p>
