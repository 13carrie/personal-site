This is a continuation of my writing on HOPE XV. I took a lot of notes during Cory Doctorow's keynote: "Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It". I found his talk to be pretty incredible, so I am transcribing/rewriting these notes here. I talked to Cory after the talk to get permission to post this--and as a bonus, he signed my HOPE program! :)

"Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It"

There is a pandemic infecting companies, and its name is 'enshittification'. Enshittification, a term coined by Cory Doctorow, involves four sequential symptoms that transform a company for the worse. It may seem like many platforms have all gotten worse suddenly, but in reality, enshittification has been slowly creeping upon us over the past fifteen years. And it results in platforms being deeply unsatisfactory for all parties, yet somehow not dying. How is this possible? Let us take Meta (Facebook) as an example.

The first three symptoms of enshittification are as follows:
1. The company is good to its end users.
2. The company abuses its end users to be good to its business customers.
3. The company abuses business customers to benefit themselves.

In Meta's case, it started off as Facebook, a social media service specific to college students. When Facebook decided to open its services to everyone, it had to compete with other services such as MySpace. Facebook drew users to its service and away from MySpace by promising better privacy and higher quality than MySpace, presenting itself as an underdog against a billionaire-owned competitor.

Once customers were drawn to and 'locked in' to this new service, Facebook began to focus on attracting business customers -- publishers and advertisers -- to its platform. It firstly did so by reneging on its promises of privacy and 'only showing you what you want to see', allowing advertisers to promote their products to specific demographics and cramming unwanted content into users' feeds. At this time, the price of advertising space was also very low. With record numbers of users on the platform and the low cost and perceived high value of advertising, business customers, too, became 'locked in' to Facebook.

To explain the third stage of enshittification, it is first necessary to discuss the concept of <u>algorithmic wage discrimination</u>. This concept can be best exemplified by Uber's payment system for their drivers. Drivers who are more selective with the trips that they accept are paid more per trip; those who accept more trips have their wages randomly and incrementally lowered. Their wages monotonically decrease, thus trapping the most desperate drivers on the platform for the lowest possible wage.

The digital flexibility that Uber has -- the ability to quickly modify their backend -- has proven to be very conducive for enshittification of Uber and other companies, including Meta. The same algorithmic manipulation that has exploited Uber drivers has also happened to publishers on Facebook. You see, once Facebook's market dominance came to fruition, they started making the same incremental negative changes to their business customers that they had made to their end users. Over time, they jacked up the price of advertising on the platform. When publishers started threatening to leave the platform, Facebook would manipulate their advertising presence, increasing their advertising impressions by the millions, to entice them to stay.

The fourth stage is more concise: <i>panic</i>, or as Meta and other enshittified companies would like you to call it, a 'pivot'. As Facebook received more and more bad press -- from lying to end users, from exploiting them for profit (see: Cambridge Analytica), from manipulating their advertisers -- they had to radically switch their image and strategy to distract from the increasingly bad quality of their platform. Their genius idea? Renaming themselves after the metaverse and attempting to sell the idea of hanging out in a primitive, low-poly virtual reality. Now <i>all</i> parties, the company, business customers and end users, are unhappy, but all are stuck.

As I previously said, all of these big tech companies have been enshittifying for a while, but all have recently declined even more rapidly. This implies that there are exogenous forces causing mass enshittification. More accurately, however, there have historically been forces preventing enshittification that have now slowly dropped away.

The first force was competition. Given appropriate competition, companies are incentivised to avoid user abuse and instead give their users the best possible experience. Over the past forty years, though, companies have been allowed to merge and acquire other companies with minimal interference. So if your competitor is stealing away your user base by giving them a better user experience? If you're Meta, Google or Amazon, your knee-jerk reaction will be to acquire them. And if that smaller competitor refuses to be acquired, the sheer size of these big tech companies allows them to operate far below cost until their competitor is forced to fold.

The second force was regulation, i.e. the duty of a government to ensure that there is a price for cheating/abuse of anti-trust laws. The issue here actually stems in part from the lack of competition. Hundreds of small- to medium-sized businesses will struggle to find any consensus against regulators, but a few large companies in a sector (or even one particularly large one) can far more easily provide a united front against potential legislation, mobilising consensus and turning it into law. The phrasing Cory Doctorow used was that instead of companies being 'too big to fail, they are too big to go to jail'.

These two anti-enshittification forces are industry-agnostic, but two more are specific to tech companies: self-help/interoperability and the 'vocational awe' of the tech workforce.

Some might say, 'why wait for regulators? Ad blockers and scripting exist, so de-shittify your web experience by yourself!' This is the core tenet of interoperability: if you don't like a platform, go to another one; if you want to gain the benefits of a platform without the shittiness, you can code that into existence. Unfortunately, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 prevents exactly that. Through the DCMA, the reverse-engineering of apps for accessing copyrighted work is prohibited. This means that anyone who creates an alternative client for Reddit or Facebook could be imprisoned for up to five years and fined up to five hundred thousand dollars. Another example of interoperability's slow death is Amazon's acquisition of Audible, which has cornered over 90% of the audiobook market. If you purchase an audiobook off of Audible, it is actually stored in an encrypted form that can only be interpreted by Amazon apps. Good luck trying to avoid these companies when they don't even let you listen to the book that you own!

The fourth and final force that has historically prevented enshittification was the culture and scarcity of workers in tech. For decades, the demand for tech workers far outpaced the supply, allowing them to hold a lot of power. To prefe
