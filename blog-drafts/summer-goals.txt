Hello and welcome to another life update!

It was only about four weeks ago that I posted my last 'now' update, but frankly, I feel very different. Three weeks from my last exam, I am much more well-rested, I am in the middle of my very lovely internship, I am going to the gym regularly again, and I generally feel motivated and refreshed.

Soon after my exams, I drafted my seasonal goals for summer, which I have now divided into six main topics: Cantonese, programming and server-side scripting, (technical) career knowledge, physical and mental well-being, creative expression, and cultivating relationships. My goal is to address at least three of these every day.

I have recently signed up for online Cantonese lessons, which begin on the sixth of June.
