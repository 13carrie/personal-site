<h2>Carrie's Guide to the World Wide Web</h2>
<p>Last updated <time datetime=""></time></p>

<p>
I wanted to make an index of a lot of the pages on the Internet
 that I enjoy, or that have helped me learn about tech, hacking,
 or anything else.
 This index is modelled
 after Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web, aka the original
 version of Yahoo :-)

<p>
A quick disclaimer: some of these sites are frequently updated
 and feature the opinions of others. I will try as much as
 possible to link to individual articles, but sometimes I will
 not. This doesn't mean that I agree with all opinions expressed
 on these sites. In fact, sometimes I heavily disagree with
 the opinions expressed. That does not mean that I think that
 these people's opinions should be stifled. I have learned a lot
 from the people I disagree with.
