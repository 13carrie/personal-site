<h4><i>defence in depth</i></h4>
<p>
Welcome to my website! I'm a MSc Information
 Technology student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
 I received my BSc Hons in Computer Science from King's College London.
 I also recently finished an IT/cybersecurity internship at Nippon Life
 Benefits.
 Here is <a href="12.02.25CV.pdf" target="_blank">my CV</a> if you are interested.
</p>
<p>
In my free time, I enjoy learning and writing about cybersecurity and
 information technology,
 reading, going to the gym, and drinking coffee.
 Right now I am working my way through every wargame on
 <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/" target="_blank">Over the Wire</a>!
</p>

<p>
I'm going to release the second part of my "Defining the Hacker" series soon --
 until then, here's my latest blog post on <a href="blogs/250421_academicreading">
how to find and read computer science academic literature</a>.

        <li>Web vulnerabilities, the Internet and its history, evolution from Web 1.0 -> Web 2.0, old viruses, worms, and useless websites</li>
