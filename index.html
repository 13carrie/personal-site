<h1>Carrie Smith</h1>
<h4><i>defence in depth</i></h4>
<p>
Welcome to my website! My name is Carrie Smith, and I'm a MSc Information Technology student at the Hong Kong University of 
Science and Technology.
</p>
<p>
I recently graduated from King's College London with a BSc Hons in Computer 
Science! I also just finished up a lovely IT/cybersecurity internship 
at Nippon Life Benefits in New York. Here is <a href="23.09.24CV.pdf">my CV</a> if you are interested.
</p>
<p>
In my free time, I enjoy learning more about security and IT (and sharing my knowledge
 here on this blog), reading, going to the gym, and drinking coffee.
 Right now I am currently working my way through the different wargames on Over the Wire!
</p>

<p>
On the 17th of October, I published my first instalment in a series on the etymology and history
 of the word 'hacker', as well as my motivational typology which
 classifies hackers as one of four types based on their main motivators. Hooray!
