    <h3>Welcome to my website!</h4>
    <p> My name is Carrie Smith and I am a Year 3 BSc Hons Computer Science student at King's College London. Here is <a href="01.03.24CV.pdf">my CV</a> if you are 
interested!
</p>
    <p>A few things I'm interested in right now (in no particular order):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anything written by Kevin Mitnick (currently working on 'The Art of Intrusion')</li>
        <li>Painting, mostly portraits</li>
        <li>My ongoing undergraduate dissertation - using machine learning to detect and explain network attacks</li>
        <li>The Internet, the history of the Internet, evolution from Web 1.0 -> Web 2.0, web vulnerabilities, old viruses, worms, and useless websites</li>
    </ul>
