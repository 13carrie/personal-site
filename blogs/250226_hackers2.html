<h2>Defining the Hacker, Part 2</h2>
<p>Posted <time datetime="2025-02-28">28 February, 2025</time></p>

<p>
Got busy -- then spent forever proofreading this. Now I'm back for another part of Defining the Hacker! This part focuses on
 financially-motivated and power-motivated hackers, as well as the relationship between the two groups.
</p>

<h4>In The Beginning... There Was The Union Dime Savings Bank</h4>
<p>Financially-motivated hackers are nothing new. I suspect that as long as there have been hackers motivated by benign curiosity,
 there have been those who are looking to gain from that curiosity. In any case, there are many ways that you can profit
 through hacking. One of the oldest approaches is traditional computer theft -- the fraudulent use of computers to steal money or other financial assets
 that you should not be authorised to access. The earliest example I could find of this was in 1970, when Roswell Steffen,
 the chief teller at the Union Dime Savings Bank, began his three-year embezzlement of US$1.5 million
 (equivalent to around $10.7 million in 2025) using a computer. Given
 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/23/archives/chief-teller-is-accused-of-theft-of-15million-at-a-bank-here-teller.html">the vague
 language used by the media to describe his hacking method</a>, such as that he mainly executed the hack by using a computer to 'shuffle numbers', it may
 be impossible for us to determine how he specifically carried out this crime -- Justin Caffier from Mashable
 <a href="https://mashable.com/article/first-cybercriminal-rosnell-steffen-scammed">even posits</a> that Steffen may not have even
 touched a computer during his crime. For his part, in a 1974 article entitled
 <a href="http://archive.informationdisplay.org/Portals/InformationDisplay/IssuePDF/V11N05-1974%20SepOctSmall.pdf">
"How I Embezzled $1.5 Million... and Nearly Got Away With It!"</a>, Steffen claimed that he simply skimmed from
 different accounts and moved funds to hide the discrepancies at convenient times, such
 as when quarterly interest payments were due. No programming necessary --
 in fact, he wrote that "programmers should be the bank's least worry" -- just a case of an internal threat who
 knew when to blame suspicious data inconsistencies on a computer bug. Needless to say, financial cyber crimes
 have become significantly more sophisticated today.
</p>
<h4>And God Said, "Let There Be Ransomware."</h4>
<p>
So what do financial hacks look like in 2025? To begin with, their perpetrators likely have
 more programming knowledge than Roswell Steffen ever did. But their method for
 profit also differs considerably -- instead of engaging in fraud or financial
 asset theft, these hackers deal in data theft and extortion. I believe this
 is both because it is now the norm to store all or most of your data digitally/online/in the cloud, and
 because the amount and value of data have increased exponentially. Data has become currency,
 thus the potential profit of stealing and reselling data can be many times that of the value of the
 data itself. In fact, withholding stolen data from its original owner and demanding payment
 for its return has become extremely lucrative: this forms the basis of modern-day ransomware.
</p>

<p>
Ransomware is a simple concept: you gain access to a target's data, you steal your own copy of the data,
 you encrypt the target's copy so that they can't access anything without a key that you conveniently
 now hold, and you demand money in exchange for the key. Ransomware specifically refers to the malware
 that encrypts your target's data, and in my opinion, it has completely redefined both financially-motivated
 hackers and hackers as a whole.
</p>

<p>
Ransomware elegantly circumvents the issues that other methods of financial hacking often encounter.
 Take Daniel Kelley's hack of the British telecom provider TalkTalk in 2015. Using SQL injection, Kelley
 was able to uncover the financial information of hundreds of thousands of TalkTalk customers. But if you're
 Kelley (or any other hacker seeking profit), and you want to profit from your hack, there are two main problems in your way.
 Firstly, according to TalkTalk,
 the hack wasn't comprehensive enough for Kelley to obtain enough of customers' banking data to make transactions
 under their names. And secondly, even if he had obtained enough of that data to do so, these customers' banks
 and credit card companies could potentially notice any unusual activity, adding intermediaries and another layer of risk to the
 whole operation. So through more 'traditional computer theft' methods, you simply wouldn't have enough anonymity to profit safely.
</p>

<p>
 Kelley's solution (in the TalkTalk case as well as other hacks) was to blackmail
 company bosses in exchange for Bitcoin, since obviously the unauthorised access or sale of customers' personally identifiable information (PII)
 could be ruinous to a company. Blackmail circumvents the issue of needing complete financial data/interacting with financial intermediaries,
 since you're only accessing the data in order to profit from blackmail payments. You maintain more anonymity compared to traditional computer theft,
 but the process could still be more advantageous for a profit-seeking hacker. After all, despite Kelley demanding over £100,000 in blackmail payments
 over the course of his many hacks, he only ever obtained around £4,000 in payments. Ransomware has all the benefits of blackmail and more: since you
 cause more disruption by holding data hostage, you are providing an additional incentive for your victim to pay you beyond the fear of reputational
 damages. Not only is the probability of payment likely greater, but your victim might even pay you more quickly so that they
 can resume business operations.
</p>

<p>
In the past few years, even more opportunities have opened up for profiting from ransomware.
RaaS?

<h4>A Brief Note About Daniel Kelley</h4>

<p>
I'd like to end the article by adding that Daniel Kelley is now a reformed white-hat hacker who has done a lot to improve the security of many companies,
 and he has done a lot of great things for cybersecurity awareness since his release from prison in 2021. I have mentioned him as an example not
 because I want to invite further criticism upon him, but because his story is a clear example of how even 'curious hackers' can quickly go down
 the pipeline of becoming 'power-seeking hackers' and subsequently 'profit-seeking hackers'.
