<h2>My Long-Overdue Reflections on HOPE XV</h2>
<p>Posted <time datetime="2024-09-12">12 September, 2024</time></p>

<p>
It's been a while! Although the 15th Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE XV) conference was just about two months ago, I still think of it basically every day.
 Even ignoring the amazing keynote by Cory Doctorow (which I've already talked about on here extensively), the whole experience was amazing. I
 can only hope that I'll be able to attend the next HOPE conference in 2026.
