<h2>Poem and other things</h2>

I hope you are all doing well. I wrote this poem at 3 am the other night:
</p>
<hr>
<h4>Secret Rush</h4>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">
a mournful horn on a summer night
the infinite exhale of the fan in the next room
highway hum
window screen vibrations from the sweet sounds outside
</pre>

I have more articles on the way, with three drafted at the moment-- 
too many ideas for articles/site features/projects, not enough time. Thanks 
to those who emailed me with NYC food recommendations and other topics.
